''' This is an implementation of the EKE algorithm.
    Why a passphrase is needed:
    The passphrase is needed to encrypt the initial messages for the key derivation (to encrypt the
    public parameters of the client)
    When a key gets derived with DH algorithm then it is used as a session key. That's what makes this
    mechanism so strong. The shared passphrase is used only at the begining, and on every connection the DH
    derives a new session-key.
    For more info see the rfc's that define EKE '''

    # we can use it with a new passphrase if we don't want to use the PASSPHRASE defined in the Constants.py
    # * the value in the Constants.py can be changed if we don't want to put a passphrase as a parameter!
    # session_key = ExchangeDHCli.exchangeDHCli(tcpSocket, "SHARED_PASS", "CLIENT_NAME") # with a new passphrase!
    session_key = ExchangeDHCli.exchangeDHCli(tcpSocket)

    # this is all that's needed to derive the key!
    ''' as an example is brought a simple echo program.
        The user inputs a message, the client encrypts it with the session key and then sends it to the server.
        The server decrypts it checks if it equals to 'quit' and if so it closes the connection.
        If the message is not quit it echoes the message to the client!
        The client checks if the message says 'quit' and if so it closes the socket. If not it just asks the
        user to send another message! '''
