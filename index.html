<p>EkePy is an implementation of EKE protocol (strong auth. protocol) in python. What i have made until now is a basic working project for an application that transports secure messages. The application contains a Client and a Server. Initially they use a chosen shared passphrase to encrypt the initial encryption of the public keys then, they derive a 2048bit session key every time they connect by means of the Diffie Hellman algorithm. The algorithm offers PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) because even if an attacker does obtain a session key he still has no control over previous and future communications (if we reset the session the key changes) and if an attacker obtains the initial shared passphrase it still cannot decrypt the messages because the key used to encrypt them is derived by Diffie Hellman. </p>

<p>At the time i'm writing this the project is functional. With functional i mean it offers the basic functionalities like sending and receiving encrypted messages. I'm still working on the project because i'm refactoring it. After this phase i would like to update it with some new functionalities like making multiple connection to the server, using a random port on connection ecc.. </p>

<p>I think the most important libraries you should have installed are: cryptography, jsonpicle, pyOpenSSL, pycrypto. 
The modules that make the encryption/decryption make a heavy use of the OpenSSL framework. </p>
